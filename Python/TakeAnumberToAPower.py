# Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (xn).
# sincer  raising an integer to a power is the same as multiplying it n times 
#  it first solution would be to multiply x , n number of times until n reaches 1


# def takeANumToAPow(base,power):
#     h = power
#     xOne=base
#     xTwo=base
#     while(h > 0):
#         xOne = xOne*xTwo
#         h = h-1
#     print(xOne)
# takeANumToAPow(2,9)

# this was a simple first iteration solution but what if power is negative ðŸ¤”
